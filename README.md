# Project Euler @ toast

Project Euler contains an archive of mathematical problems that can be solved
with programming. As an aspiring polyglot, I want to use these as exercises to
practice different languages and their standard libraries with the least amout
of friction.


#### Languages I Plan to Work With

- JavaScript (ECMAScript 6, favoring new syntax)
- CoffeeScript (v1.9, favoring functional programming)
- Haskell (ghc v7.6)
- Elixir (v1.1)
- Erlang
- Python (v3, favoring list comprehensions)
- Lua (v5.2, LuaJIT)


#### Languages I Might Consider (Some May Have Some Technical Difficulties)

- Elm
- Clojure
- PHP
- Ruby

### Directory Structure

To keep it all about as consistent as possible, the directory structure will
look like `eulers/PROBLEM_#/FILE_EXTENSION/main.ext`. Noteable exception is
Haskell with filename of `Main.hs`. This structure will make it easier to
manage, make senses of, and script.


### Running a 'Suite'

I say 'suite' because I have a minimal `bash` script that will run the scripts
of a problem @ `bash run_euler.sh <problem #>`.
