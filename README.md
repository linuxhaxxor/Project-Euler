# Project Euler @ toast

Project Euler contains an archive of mathematical problems that can be solved
with programming. As an aspiring polyglot, I want to use these as exercises to
practice different languages and their standard libraries.

#### Languages I Plan to Work With
- JavaScript
- CoffeeScript
- Haskell
- Elixir
- Erlang
- Python
- Lua

#### Languages I Might Consider (Some May Have Some Technical Difficulties)
- Elm
- Clojure
- PHP
- Ruby
