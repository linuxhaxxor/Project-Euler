# Project Euler @ toast

Project Euler contains an archive of mathematical problems that can be solved
with programming. As an aspiring polyglot, I want to use these as exercises to
practice different languages and their standard libraries.

#### Languages I Plan to Work With
- JavaScript (ECMAScript 6, favoring new syntax)
- CoffeeScript (v1.9, favoring functional programming)
- Haskell (ghc v7.6)
- Elixir (v1.1)
- Erlang
- Python (v3, favoring list comprehensions)
- Lua (5.2)

#### Languages I Might Consider (Some May Have Some Technical Difficulties)
- Elm
- Clojure
- PHP
- Ruby
