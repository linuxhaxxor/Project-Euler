The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

Edit: because I'm more interested in solving the problem conceptually without
high-level mathematics, and there are limits to memory (and call stacks in
non-tail-call-optimized languages), I'm just going to solve for the example
because the number in solve-for is causing my system to bawk.

Answer: 29
